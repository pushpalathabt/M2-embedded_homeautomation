# M2-embedded_homeautomation
Home automation make r home smarter & life easier.

The purpose of this  project is to develop a system for controlling common home electrical devices using wireless to enable direct control.
Commonly, home automation software gives the user access to an interface to the 
home automation system by attaching a home automation computer to the wireless network. This project report entitled as “Home Automation Using RF” gives a detailed description of home automation in general and practical implementation done by us in this project. We have covered around some basic most needed modules which are in general required for every household.  These modules cover Lighting control of the house, curtain control, Fan control, gate contol and security control of outer portion of house. All needed components and equipments are listed with their cost analysis and a short description of cost effective implementation is given for normal household. Moving on further a brief knowledge future enhancements is also provided in order to upgrade this project to higher level.
