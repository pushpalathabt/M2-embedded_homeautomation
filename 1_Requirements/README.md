 ## INTRODUCTION
 Home automation, often referred to as domotics is building automation for a home, called a
smart home or smart house. The purpose of this  project is to develop a system for controlling common home electrical devices using wireless to enable direct control.
Commonly, home automation software gives the user access to an interface to the home automation system by attaching a home automation computer to the wireless network. 
This project report entitled as “Home Automation Using RF” gives a detailed description of home automation in general and practical implementation done by us in this project.
We have covered around some basic most needed modules which are in general required for every household. Further this report describes each of the modules used while making 
this project, and also a description of each and every step of their construction is given. These modules cover Lighting control of the house, curtain control, Fan control,
gate contol and security control of outer portion of house. All needed components and equipments are listed with their cost analysis and a short description of cost effective implementation is given for normal household. Moving on further a brief knowledge future enhancements is also provided in order to upgrade this project to higher level.


## RESEARCH
Home automation  system makes the operations of various home appliances more convenient
and saves energy. With the energy saving concept, Smarthome automation or building automation
makes life very simple nowadays. It involves automatic controlling of all electrical or
